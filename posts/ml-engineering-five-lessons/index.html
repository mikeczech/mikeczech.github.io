<h1 class="post-title">Five Lessons from Two Years of ML Engineering</h1>
    
    <time>April 18, 2020</time>
    
    <div>
        <p>
        <p>Today, an increasing number of companies understand that data science isn’t just about presenting insights from data analysis to decision makers, but about building <em>data science applications</em> such as recommendation systems or spam filters. Thus, data science teams often not only consist of data scientists, but also of <strong>machine learning engineers</strong> who bridge the gap between data science and software engineering.</p>
<p>Here, I want to share five lessons I&rsquo;ve learned in the past two years working as a machine learning engineer on a variety of products.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-1-take-care-of-your-feedback-cycle">Lesson 1: Take Care of your Feedback Cycle</h2>
<p>In traditional software development, the feedback cycle while developing is fairly straightforward. For instance, in <strong>Test-Driven Development</strong> developers always write an automated test first, check that it fails, subsequently add code until the test succeeds, and repeat. Notice that the development speed largely depends on the ability to quickly write fast running tests.</p>
<p>When building data science applications, the feedback cycle can introduce new challenges. Figure 1 depicts a simplified picture of such a cycle.</p>
<figure class="figure-default">
    <img src="/ds-feedback-loop.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Figure 1: The General Structure of a Feedback Cycle in Data Science</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First of all, the feedback cycle involves steps that can take a reasonable amount of time (e.g. model training). This is problematic, because it leads to a lot of interruptions and context-switches. I usually start to work on something else while waiting for a long-running task to finish, only to be interrupted after a few minutes or hours again.</p>
<p>Furthermore, model evaluation and analysis can become non-trivial due to optimizing a metric that only correlates with the actual metric(s) to be optimized. For example, a machine learning algorithm might optimize the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html">mean squared error</a> whereas the overall objective is to optimize the <a href="https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Conversion_Rate">conversion rate</a> of an online shop. An accurate judgement of a model&rsquo;s performance thus requires thorough A/B testing, which can take weeks or months. Months! It may take months until you can be reasonably sure that your code has a positive impact on the product.</p>
<p>I recommend monitoring the performance of your feedback cycle as you monitor all the other metrics that you already have. How long does it take to train a model? How much time does the team spend on deploying something to production? How long do A/B tests take? Make key metrics visible. Identify, prioritize, and get rid of bottlenecks in the same manner as you would approach bad predictions of your model.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-2-think-big-but-start-small">Lesson 2: Think Big, but Start Small</h2>
<p>As obvious as it sounds, it often isn&rsquo;t: Starting with a simple solution often spares you a lot of trouble. I get it &ndash; there are lots of exciting developments in data science and we all want to take part in those. It&rsquo;s more fun to learn about <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html">transformers</a> instead of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">tf-idf</a> for the thousandth time to solve your NLP task. Story time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The e-commerce company Amaton instructs the <em>AICorp Inc</em> to develop a model that predicts the demand of products in order to optimize their warehouse logistics. A team of data scientists and engineers immediately starts cleaning the data, engineering features, training and testing different models, and &ndash; after six months of hard work &ndash; they proudly deliver an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning">ensemble model</a> that beats Amaton&rsquo;s decade-old, rule-based demand-prediction in a carefully designed A/B test. Great!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a problem, though. It turns out that the model is quite complex and maintaining it requires considerable effort and financial investments. After two years of almost daily emergencies, a smart intern discovers that a simple heuristic, which mainly computes a product of click and order counts of the last three days, performs only negligibly worse than the complex model. Oh no.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story illustrates that machine learning is not always the answer. Simple heuristics can also lead to meaningful results and are much easier to maintain. Thus, it&rsquo;s reasonable to try a simple solution first. As a heuristic is becoming more complex, there is a point where machine learning is the way to go. Ask yourself: Does the accuracy of a more complex model justify the additional effort for maintenance in a production setting? <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Often it does, but sometimes it‘s just not worth it. Start simple and increase the complexity step by step, always considering the impact on the whole system.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-3-write-tests-for-your-queries">Lesson 3: Write Tests for your Queries</h2>
<p>About two years ago, I had an intense discussion about the usefulness of having unit tests for SQL queries. Today, we are glad that the outcome was to apply common best practices like <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html">Test-driven development (TDD)</a> on queries as well.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> This made sense because, by now, we heavily rely on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">Google BigQuery</a> for feature engineering in SQL. Thus, testing queries gave us more confidence in the overall correctness of a product where SQL is a big piece of the cake.</p>
<p>We had two requirements: First, writing tests must be simple &ndash; developers generally avoid testing if writing a test takes too much effort. Second, test cases must run against a database that implements the semantics of the real thing.</p>
<p>What worked for us is to write a small framework in Python which provides tools for temporarily creating domain-specific mock tables in BigQuery. Such tables are created during test execution. It also lets any FROM / JOIN statements automatically point to the mock tables. Due to the difficulty of locally executing queries in a meaningful way, tests always run on BigQuery itself, which is usually fast enough when running multiple tests in parallel &ndash; remember the feedback-cycle!</p>

<h2 id="lesson-4-pick-a-good-workflow-management-tool">Lesson 4: Pick a Good Workflow Management Tool</h2>
<p>A <em>workflow management tool</em> glues together all the parts that comprise a data science application &ndash; data processing, model training, deployment,  and so on. When I started using workflow management tools, I didn&rsquo;t know what to look for, which led to issues that were difficult to fix later. This lesson therefore covers properties of workflow management tools that turned out to be important:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pick a tool that <strong>encourages best practices of software engineering</strong>. Everything should be configurable as code &ndash; from the deployment of the tool itself to the workflows it is going to execute. Also, make sure that individual tasks of workflows run inside self-contained environments (e.g. using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>). Often, workflows combine lots of different tools and programming languages, so you want to stay flexible without running into dependency issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ideally, your tool of choice is able to <strong>distribute different resources</strong> like CPUs, GPUs, and RAM among its workflow tasks. Training a model possibly requires vastly different resources than running a simple SQL query. In public cloud environments, it&rsquo;s also advisable that the tool supports <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html">spot instances</a> (AWS) or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible">preemptible VMs</a> (GCP) to keep the costs low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure the tool performs the basics well enough.</strong> It should be easy to pass artifacts from one workflow task to the next. Here, an artifact can be the standard output (e.g. in the JSON format) or a large file (e.g. a model). Reading and persisting logs of individual tasks should also be dead simple.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are many, many more aspects that make a good tool for workflow management, but those three are standing out for me. Currently, I prefer <a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo">Argo</a> running on a managed Kubernetes cluster (e.g. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE</a>). Nonetheless, always pick a tool that fits your current needs and the needs of the <em>foreseeable</em> future. If your workflow consists of only a few sequential tasks, a simple <em>cron job</em> might be sufficient. Remember to start simple.</p>
<h2 id="lesson-5-keep-your-jupyter-notebooks-clean">Lesson 5: Keep your Jupyter Notebooks Clean</h2>
<p>What I find challenging is to unite the data science part of constantly ongoing research with the goal of building a product. I have seen projects where a data scientist developed a model in a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>, which was then &ldquo;thrown over the fence&rdquo; to a software engineer who then reimplemented everything from scratch to make it deployable. Thereby, Notebooks were regarded as a disposable by-product. That, to me, certainly doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>
<p>Instead, I now advise to treat Jupyter notebooks much like &ldquo;real&rdquo; code from the beginning. Notebooks are great for data analysis, but they can quickly become messy due to a lack of code hygiene. The first insight thus is to apply well-established practices of software engineering on notebooks as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aim for small notebooks by continuously moving code from notebook cells into external, unit-tested modules. Ideally, notebooks only act as an orchestrator for running high-level tasks and plotting their results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put your notebooks into version control (e.g. by using tools like <a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext">jupytext</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What also turned out to be helpful is to restrict every notebook to a single purpose (e.g. data preparation). The larger a notebook becomes the more likely a subtle mistake is made somewhere. Moreover, small, single-purpose notebooks are great for setting up multiple experiments that only differ in very specific ways (e.g. the type of model).</p>
<p>A more controversial, yet interesting idea is to let your workflow management <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6">automatically execute notebooks</a> to orchestrate more complex experiments, as illustrated in Figure 5. Following all the best practices above, and only then, automatically running notebooks can be indeed useful.</p>
<figure class="figure-default">
    <img src="/notebooks.jpg"/> <figcaption>
            <h4>Figure 5: Orchestrating a Composition of Notebooks</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are caveats, though. Not everyone in your team might be proficient in best practices of software engineering. Moreover, there are cases where it&rsquo;s useful to focus on experimentation only &ndash; though having clean notebooks certainly supports the reproducibility of your results.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced the largest boost in productivity when data scientists and engineers work together. But why are we still talking about two separate roles? One final piece of advice I can leave here is that it&rsquo;s important to let data scientists still work in a scientific way. Don&rsquo;t approach every data science task the same way you would approach a software engineering task &ndash; and vice-versa. Don&rsquo;t require that a data scientist writes unit tests for every new feature immediately. Don&rsquo;t accept bad practices when code leaves the experimentation phase to enter a production environment. Keep working together, but recognize that data science is not software engineering. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Model interpretability is also becoming difficult with increasingly complex models &ndash; e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04131">https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04131</a> <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Note that this is only true for queries that are used in production environments. I&rsquo;m still not convinced that testing queries in more experimental settings makes sense as well (e.g. in Jupyter notebooks). <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>People sometimes argue that unit tests increase the probability that the code is correct. That&rsquo;s true. But from my point of view, the purpose of tests is mainly to make sure that we don&rsquo;t break something when <em>changing the code</em>. Testing a machine learning feature whose usefulness isn&rsquo;t proven just slows you down. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
