      <description>Update 14/03/21: Google recently announced that the Artifact Registry now supports PyPI repositories as well (alpha). I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the time to test it myself yet, but it definitely looks promising. Thus, please consider to use the Artifact Registry instead.
Every once in a while I am trying to solve a problem that is seemingly so fundamental that there must exist an off-the-shelf solution already. Setting up a private repository for Python packages on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) falls into this category.</description>

      <description>In my team, we regularly run batch jobs with very specific hardware requirements. A typical example is model training which usually requires (multiple) GPUs to finish within a reasonable amount of time. To run such jobs, we use the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) which is a managed service on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The workflow is to submit a job and let Kubernetes allocate the required resources, run the job, and finally deallocate the acquired resources to avoid unnecessary costs.</description>
